## Question Marker

[Statement] か 
か is most usually used to indicate a question, and the sound must uplift at the end. The answer to this question is most usually replacing the question flag with the answer and then responding without か.  [[Explanations#^d24459|Explained here]]

## Usage of は 

は is a very important participle in the Language. It shows the indicator of subject, able to model questions and much more : 

- N1 は N2 です - Here は sets the subject as N1, and thus affirms that N2 is related to N1. This sometimes, maybe omitted, as context forces some sentences to remove necessary parts. [[Explanations#^695944|Explained here]] 
- Nは? -> This is primary used to aim the question towards another person, the question already being asked to someone else. Here once again context removes the need for repeating the question. The response to this **CANNOT** be a はい/いいえ. 

## Usage of も

 も is a particle that means “also” or “the same as.”  It allows the speaker to agree to the question, as well as bring attention to the fact that her answer is also the same. [[Examples#Example usage of も|An Example]]
