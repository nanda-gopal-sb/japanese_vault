1. Japanese is a very context aware language. And so when it is obvious that some information can be inferred from the context, person speaking, current subject, previous statement etc that particular information is omitted. Examples : ^695944
	1. わたしのなまえはたなかです。ー＞　たなかです。(Since the person speaking is sure to use his name, and not anyone else's "わたしの" Is removed.)
	2. そうですか。
	3. lmao
	4. fr tho
	5. infernape about to go stupiddddd
	6. my flames are eternal
2. からきました。Cannot be used, as it answers "Where are you coming from", but since we arent in Japan yet, インドじんです。will suffice. ^9432dc
3. Responding to a sentence in Japanese, involves just replacing the question marker ("where?", "who?", "what?") with the response and then removing か. (Most of the time) ^d24459
